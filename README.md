# Note Manager

[Demo](https://cford256.github.io/Note-Manager/)

Note Manager saves all of your data local in your browser. There is no server that it syncs your notes with.

This application is intended to offer an alternative store notes on your computer. Whenever I think of something that I want to work on but don't currently have time to do so, I have the habit of simply writting down it down inside of Sticky Notes.

The probem is that I don't ever actually refer back to these notes to review what I have written. My notes inevitably to be very cluttered and unorganized. They often even have multiple notes reminding me of the same thing.

This application is intended to provide a bit more structure to taking notes. The ablity to include images and create tables will hopefully make it easier to create meaningfull notes that you will actually refer back to.
